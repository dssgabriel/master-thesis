I want to express my most sincere appreciation for my supervisor at the CEA, Cédric Chevalier, who supported me throughout this internship and always provided me with good advice on how to improve. His deep technical insight into efficient software engineering and expert knowledge of modern hardware architectures were of tremendous help when I got stuck on challenging problems.

I am also especially grateful to my co-supervisor, Hugo Taboada, for his help and advice whenever I had questions. He accompanied me throughout this internship and this endeavor would not have been possible without him.

Thanks should also go to Thao, Hélène, Nathalie, and all the Teratec Campus staff who welcomed me daily for their availability and cheerfulness.

I am also thankful to my family who supported me during those six months. A special thanks to my girlfriend who put her graphic design skills to good use and helped me make some of the diagrams and figures presented in this report.

Finally, I would like to have a word for my fellow interns who have paced my days and with whom I was able to have deeply geeky conversations that sparked brilliant ideas for my work. Many thanks for all the coffee breaks and the intense board games after lunch!
