I want to express my most sincere appreciation for my supervisor at the CEA, Cédric Chevalier, who supported me throughout this internship and always provided me with good advice on how to improve. His deep technical insight into efficient software engineering and expert knowledge of modern hardware architectures were of tremendous help when I got stuck on challenging problems.

I am also thankful to my co-supervisor, Hugo Taboada, for his help and advice whenever I had questions. He accompanied me whenever Cédric was not available and this work would not have been possible without him.

Thanks should also go to Thao, Hélène, Nathalie, and all the Teratec Campus staff who welcomed me daily for their availability and cheerfulness throughout this internship.

Finally, I would like to have a word for my fellow interns who have paced my days and with whom I was able to have deeply geeky conversations that sparked brilliant ideas for my work. Many thanks for the coffee breaks and intense board games after lunch!
